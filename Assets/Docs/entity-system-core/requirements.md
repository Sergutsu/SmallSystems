# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Entity System Core is the foundational module for Galactic Ventures that provides a unified entity management system for all game objects. This system serves as the backbone for managing ships, stations, celestial bodies, factions, and other game entities with a component-based architecture that integrates seamlessly with Unity's existing systems. The core system enables dynamic component attachment, centralized entity tracking, and event-driven communication between different game systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a unified entity management system, so that all game objects can be consistently tracked and managed across different systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new game object is created THEN the system SHALL automatically assign a unique entity ID
2. WHEN an entity is registered THEN the system SHALL store it in a central registry accessible by entity ID
3. WHEN an entity is destroyed THEN the system SHALL automatically remove it from the registry and notify dependent systems
4. IF an entity lookup is requested with an invalid ID THEN the system SHALL return null without throwing exceptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a flexible component system, so that entities can have different capabilities without requiring inheritance hierarchies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is added to an entity THEN the system SHALL store the component and trigger a ComponentAddedEvent
2. WHEN a component is requested from an entity THEN the system SHALL return the component if it exists or null if it doesn't
3. WHEN a component is removed from an entity THEN the system SHALL remove it and trigger a ComponentRemovedEvent
4. IF multiple components of the same type are added THEN the system SHALL replace the existing component with the new one

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want an event-driven communication system, so that different game systems can react to entity changes without tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity event occurs THEN the system SHALL broadcast the event through the EventBus
2. WHEN a system subscribes to an event type THEN the system SHALL receive all future events of that type
3. WHEN a system unsubscribes from an event type THEN the system SHALL no longer receive events of that type
4. IF an event handler throws an exception THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other handlers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want faction-based entity organization, so that entities can be grouped and managed by their allegiance or ownership.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity is created THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of a faction identifier
2. WHEN entities are queried by faction THEN the system SHALL return all entities belonging to that faction
3. WHEN an entity's faction changes THEN the system SHALL trigger a FactionChangedEvent
4. IF a faction query is made for a non-existent faction THEN the system SHALL return an empty collection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want seamless Unity integration, so that the entity system works naturally with Unity's existing component system and editor tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the entity system is used THEN it SHALL integrate with Unity's MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods
2. WHEN entities are viewed in the Unity Inspector THEN the system SHALL display entity ID and faction information
3. WHEN the game is in Play mode THEN the system SHALL provide real-time debugging information in the Inspector
4. IF the system is used in Edit mode THEN it SHALL validate entity data and provide helpful error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want persistent entity data, so that entity states can be saved and restored across game sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entity data needs to be saved THEN the system SHALL serialize entity state to a persistent format
2. WHEN entity data is loaded THEN the system SHALL restore entity state and re-register entities
3. WHEN serialization occurs THEN the system SHALL handle ScriptableObject components appropriately
4. IF serialization fails for any component THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want component lifecycle management, so that components can be properly initialized and cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is added to an entity THEN the system SHALL call the component's initialization method if it exists
2. WHEN an entity is destroyed THEN the system SHALL call cleanup methods on all attached components
3. WHEN a component is removed THEN the system SHALL call the component's cleanup method if it exists
4. IF a component lifecycle method throws an exception THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want entity querying capabilities, so that I can efficiently find entities based on various criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entities are queried by component type THEN the system SHALL return all entities with that component
2. WHEN entities are queried by multiple criteria THEN the system SHALL return entities matching all criteria
3. WHEN a spatial query is performed THEN the system SHALL return entities within the specified area or range
4. IF a query returns no results THEN the system SHALL return an empty collection rather than null
